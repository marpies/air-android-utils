         * {@link android.view.WindowManager.LayoutParams#FLAG_FULLSCREEN
         * WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_FULLSCREEN},
         * meaning that non-critical screen decorations (such as the status bar) will be

         * <p>This approach to going fullscreen is best used over the window flag when
         * it is a transient state -- that is, the application does this at certain
         * points in its user interaction where it wants to allow the user to focus
         * on content, but not as a continuous state.  For situations where the application
         * would like to simply stay full screen the entire time (such as a game that

         * {@link android.view.WindowManager.LayoutParams#FLAG_FULLSCREEN window flag}

         * the other system UI states.
         *
         * <p>When using this flag, the application should provide some easy facility
         * for the user to go out of it.  A common example would be in an e-book
         * reader, where tapping on the screen brings back whatever screen and UI
         * decorations that had been hidden while the user was immersed in reading
         * the book.
